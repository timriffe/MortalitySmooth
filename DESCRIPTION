Description: Smoothing one- and two-dimensional Poisson counts with
             P-splines specifically tailored to mortality data.  
             Extra-Poisson variation can be accounted as well as forecasting.
             Collection of mortality data and a specific function for
	     selecting those data by country, sex, age and years.
